This project provides an implementation of the Stack data structure in Python. A stack operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

The implementation includes:
1.Basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
2.Utility functions to check stack size and whether it is empty.
3.A display method to visualize the stack's contents.
